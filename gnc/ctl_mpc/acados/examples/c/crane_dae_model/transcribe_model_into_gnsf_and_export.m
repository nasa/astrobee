%% Description
% This script analyzes a CasADi expression f_impl in the symbolic CasADi
% variables x, xdot, u, z, which all togehther represent an implicit ODE/
% index-1 DAE.
% The expression and the variables should be provided as in the example
% file, export_pendulum_dae_model;
% It will create a struct "gnsf" containing all information needed to use
% it with the gnsf integrator in acados and can generate the neccessary C
% functions.
% Additionally it will create the struct "reordered_model" which contains
% the permuted state vector and permuted f_impl, in which additionally some
% functions, which were made part of the linear output system of the gnsf,
% have changed signs.
% The C functions to simulate the system as an implicit ODE can also be
% generated
