"""
Example of the frc_racecars in simulation without obstacle avoidance:
This example is for the optimal racing of the frc race cars. The model is a simple bicycle model and the lateral acceleration is constraint in order to validate the model assumptions.
The simulation starts at s=-2m until one round is completed(s=8.71m). The beginning is cut in the final plots to simulate a 'warm start'.
