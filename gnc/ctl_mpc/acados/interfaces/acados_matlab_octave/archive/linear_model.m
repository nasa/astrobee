function model = linear_model()

%% this function generates an explicit ODE test model,
% represented as a Matlab struct "model".
% It consists of a CasADi expression f_expl_expr
% that depends on the symbolic CasADi variables x, xdot, u (also part of
% "model"), a model name, which will be used as a prefix for the name of 
% generated C functions to use the model with acados.
