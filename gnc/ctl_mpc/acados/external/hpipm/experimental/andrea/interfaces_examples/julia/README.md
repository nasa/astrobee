HPIPM examples using the hpipm_julia module. In order to be able to run the examples in this folder from Julia (version > 0.5 required), it is necessary to install the shared libraries libblasfeo.so and libhpipm.so. The required shared libraries can be installed by running 'make shared_library -j4 & sudo make install_shared' from the blasfeo and hpipm root folder. Make sure that the location of libblasfeo.so and libhpipm.so is known to the system by adding /opt/blasfeo/lib and /opt/hpipm/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. In order to be able to call the Python interpreter from Julia you will need to install the PyCall Julia package (https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) by running 'Pkg.build("PyCall")'. Finally, you will need to make sure that hpipm/interfaces/julia/hpipm_julia.jl is included (run include <path_to_hpipm_julia.jl>) and that hpipm_python has been installed for the Python version used by Julia. You can set the path to the desired version of the Python intepreter by running 'ENV["PYTHON"] = 'path_to_python_interpreter'' from Julia before building PyCall.
