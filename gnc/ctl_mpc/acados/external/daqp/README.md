# DAQP
DAQP is a dual active-set solver that solves convex quadratic programs of the form
```
minimize        0.5 x' H x + f' x

subject to      l  <=  x  <= u
		bl <=  Ax <= bu.
```
Binary constraints of the form $A x \in \lbrace b_l, b_u \rbrace$ are also supported, allowing for mixed-integer quadratic programs to be solved.

The code is written in C and is *library free*. DAQP can be interfaced to C, Julia, MATLAB, and Python. 

See [Documentation](https://darnstrom.github.io/daqp/) for an installation guide and basic use of the interfaces.
