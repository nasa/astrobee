SCIENTIFIC MENTORS
==================

We also would like to thank two persons who had a major share in making 
qpOASES a success. Not by writing even a single line of code, but by 
establishing the idea of using a homotopy-based approach for high-speed 
QP solutions and by excellent scientific guidance during the development 
process:

    Hans Georg Bock
    Moritz Diehl 



All users are invited to further improve qpOASES by providing comments, 
code enhancements, bug reports, additional documentation or whatever you 
feel is missing.
