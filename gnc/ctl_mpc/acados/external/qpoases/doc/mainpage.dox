 *
 *	This is an almost complete plain C, static memory translation of qpOASES,

 *
 *	\section sec_developers Authors and Contributors
 *
 *	qpOASES's core functionality and software design have been developed by 
 *  the following main developers (in alphabetical order):
 *  <ul>
  *	<li>Hans Joachim Ferreau
 *  <li>Christian Kirches
 *  <li>Andreas Potschka
 *	</ul>
 *
 *	Moreover, the following developers have contributed code to qpOASES's 
 *	third-party interfaces (in alphabetical order):
 *  <ul>
 *	<li>Alexander Buchner
 *	<li>Holger Diedam
 *	<li>Manuel Kudruss
 *  <li>Sebastian F. Walter
 *	</ul>
 *
 *	Finally, the following people have not contributed to the source code, 
 *  but have helped making qpOASES even more useful by testing, reporting 
 *  bugs or proposing algorithmic improvements (in alphabetical order): 
 *  <ul>
 *	<li>Eckhard Arnold
 *	<li>Boris Houska
 *  <li>D. Kwame Minde Kufoalor
 *	<li>Aude Perrin
 *	<li>Milan Vukov
 *	<li>Thomas Wiese
 *	<li>Leonard Wirsching
 *	</ul>
 *
 *	We also would like to thank two persons who had a major share in making 
 *	qpOASES a success. Not by writing even a single line of code, but by 
 *	establishing the idea of using a homotopy-based approach for high-speed 
 *	QP solutions and by excellent scientific guidance during the development 
 *	process:
 *	<ul>
 *	<li>Hans Georg Bock
 *	<li>Moritz Diehl 
 *	</ul>
 *
 *	All users are invited to further improve qpOASES by providing comments, code enhancements, 
 *	bug reports, additional documentation or whatever you feel is missing. The preferred way
 *  of doing so is to <b>create a <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/qpOASES/newticket">new ticket</a>
 *  at the qpOASES webpage</b>. In case you do not want to disclose your feedback to the public, 
 *  you may send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@qpOASES.org">support@qpOASES.org</a> 
 *	or contact one of the main developers directly.
