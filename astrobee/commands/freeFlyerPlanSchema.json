Within the segment, desired pose and velocity are smoothly interpolated functions of time over a time interval [t0, t1]. Plans created by the Astrobee control station plan editor always specify each segment's time values relative to the start of that segment's execution (i.e. t0 = 0). These plans must be executed in immediate mode, so called because when execution reaches a new segment, the executive and choreographer immediately 'start the clock' on executing the timed trajectory. In principle, if you want to synchronize motion of multiple robots, it could be useful to have the interval [t0, t1] specified using absolute timestamps. That is the behavior when immediate mode is disabled. The timestamp t0 is interpreted as absolute time using ROS conventions (usually UNIX epoch when running on real hardware, but could be any arbitrary time scale when running in simulation), and the start of motion on the segment would be delayed until the current time t = t0.<p/>At this time, we cannot recommend disabling immediate mode to achieve synchronization, due to the following concerns: (1) execution with absolute timestamps has never really been tested, and may be buggy, (2) the control station plan editor doesn't provide any way to generate segments with absolute timestamps, (3) since it is seldom possible to predict exactly when ISS conditions will be right to begin a multi-robot activity, it would be awkward in practice to have the exact absolute timing of segments hard-coded into the plans.<p/>As an alternative way to synchronize motion, you can execute with immediate mode enabled as usual, but take special care to minimize any skew in start time. Upload the plans in advance, use the Mobility.prepare command to get the robots ready to move, and then run the plans simultaneously. There could be up to a half a second of delay between the robots starting their plans. See also Settings.setTimeSync. Astrobee to Astrobee communication is also in the works, and may eventually enable synchronizing Astrobees in a better way.<p/>Note: Immediate mode motion control is not related to immediate download (as in Data.setDataToDisk).",
