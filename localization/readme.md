\page localization Localization

This folder consists of various sensing algorithms which serve as input to localization, along with the graph-based localizer and helper libraries for components of its functionality.  It also contains libraries for other localization functionality, such as imu augmentation, a ground truth localizer primarily for use with simulation, and a vive localization package.
