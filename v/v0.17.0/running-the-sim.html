<div class="textblock"><p>This documentation assumes you have followed the <a class="el" href="install-nonNASA.html">Install for general users</a> or the <a class="el" href="install-NASA.html">Install for NASA users</a> documentation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md530"></a>
Communication Nodes</h2>
<p>If you are an external user and would like to install and run the Astrobee communication nodes, please contact your Astrobee point of contact.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md531"></a>
Setting up your Environment</h2>
<p>You will need to setup your environment so that ROS knows about the new packages provided by Astrobee flight software: </p><pre class="fragment">pushd $BUILD_PATH
source devel/setup.bash
popd
</pre><p>In case of a Zsh session, do </p><pre class="fragment">pushd $BUILD_PATH
source devel/setup.zsh
popd
</pre><p>After this command has completed, you should be able to run <code>ros</code> commands from any directory in your Linux filesystem.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md532"></a>
Running the Simulator</h2>
<p>To start a simulation of a single Astrobee docked in the ISS, run one of the following:</p>
<p>If you don't have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, please run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch dds:=false robot:=sim_pub rviz:=true
</pre><p>If you have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, please run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch rviz:=true
</pre><ul>
<li>Note 1: The very first time Gazebo starts, it could take a long time because it loads some large models</li>
<li>Note 2: To run the simulation with the Gazebo rendering, you can add the flag <code>sviz:=true</code>. This allows one to see the ISS module used for the simulation. However this is resource intensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>This command tells ROS to look for the <code>sim.launch</code> file provided by the <code>astrobee</code> package, and use roslaunch to run it. Internally, ROS maintains a cache of information about package locations, libraries and executables. If you find that the above command doesn't work, try rebuilding the cache: </p><pre class="fragment">rospack profile
</pre><p>This command launches both the world and Astrobee. There are things in the world that need to be started up before Astrobee is started up. There is a small chance that this will not happen and the user will experience issues upon start up. If this happens, please see the 'Issues Starting up the Simulator' section in <a class="el" href="sim-issues.html">Common Simulation Issues</a>.</p>
<p><b>Important</b>: If you experience issues with the simulator and commanding the robot, please see the <a class="el" href="sim-issues.html">Common Simulation Issues</a> before contacting the Astrobee team.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md533"></a>
Simulator Flags</h3>
<p>There are many options when launching the simulator. This section will take you through the most used options. If you are happy with the simulator setup from above, you can skip this section and jump to the <a href="#moving-the-robot">Moving the Robot</a> section.</p>
<p><b>Important</b>: You can specify more than one flag meaning you could launch more than one of the GUIs we offer. The simulator is very resource intensive. The more GUIs running, the more likely it is that you will get tolerance violation errors when you try to move. If you are running a virtual machine, please make sure that it has access to your graphics card.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md534"></a>
pose</h4>
<p>This is the pose/location that Astrobee starts up at. The first 3 values are position and the last 4 are the orientation expressed as a quaternion. By default, Astrobee starts up docked in the JEM module of the ISS. To start up </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch dds:=false robot:=sim_pub rviz:=true pose:="11.25 -6.95 4.49 0 0 0 1"
</pre><p><em>Note: If you have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, please omit the dds and robot flags.</em></p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md535"></a>
gds</h4>
<p>This flag is used to start up the ground data system (GDS). For the flag to work, gds must be setup in a certain location. See the <a href="#ground-data-system">Ground Data System</a> section for more about GDS and instructions on how to set it up. Please note that GDS will be unable to connect to and command Astrobee if the Astrobee communication nodes are not running. Also note, GDS is the least computationally intensive GUI out of the 3 we offer and it is the only GUI that allows users to send commands. Thus, it may be a convenient tool for external users to use. </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch gds:=true
</pre><p><em>Note: If you don't have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, the roslaunch above will throw a dds ros bridge fault and you will not be able to move Astrobee.</em></p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md536"></a>
rviz</h4>
<p>This flag is used to start up the ros visualization system also known as RVIZ. RVIZ is our second most computationally intensive GUI.</p>
<p><em>Note: <code>rviz</code> displays the robot perception of the world (estimated pose, sensor measurements, etc.).</em></p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md537"></a>
sviz</h4>
<p>This flag is used to start up the Gazebo GUI. This GUI is the most computationally intensive GUI we have. We recommend using this GUI if you have a high performance machine.</p>
<p><em>Note: <code>sviz</code> displays the model of the world (ground truth). This means that the position represented in rviz or gds can differ from the position in sviz.</em></p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md538"></a>
gviz</h4>
<p>This flag starts the gnc visualizer. This visualizer is mainly used to see how the localization and gnc systems are performing. For more information no gviz, please see the <a class="el" href="gncvisualizer.html">GNC Visualizer</a> documentation.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md539"></a>
dds</h4>
<p>This flag is used to start the Astrobee communication nodes. There are two communication nodes in the Astrobee flight software: the dds ros bridge and the astrobee to astrobee communication node. If you are unable to compile or install the Astrobee communication nodes, please set dds to 'false' and set robot to 'sim_pub'.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md540"></a>
speed</h4>
<p>This flag is the speed multiplier for the simulator. By default, it is set to 1 meaning the simulator runs in real time. If you are having issues with simulator performance, you can slow the simulator down by specifying a value less than one. For example, the following would slow the simulator down to half speed: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch dds:=false robot:=sim_pub rviz:=true speed:=0.5
</pre><p><em>Note: If you have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, please omit the dds and robot flags.</em></p>
<p>If you have a high performance machine, you can speed up the simulator by specifying a value greater than 1. Please note, if you specify a speed up greater than what your computer can handle, the simulator will not run at the speed you specified. In this case, you can run gz stats in another terminal to figure out what the actual speed up is. If the factor in gz stats doesn't match the speed you specified, you can expect weird simulator issues.</p>
<p>Also note that all GUIs have a substantial effect on performance and care should be taken when speeding up the simulation with GUIs enabled. Under certain high-load conditions (many robots and/or a high speed factor) the outgoing heartbeat queue in simulation ends up being too small for the number of messages that must be delivered. The outcome is this error message in your console: </p><pre class="fragment">[ERROR] [&lt;timestamp&gt;] : (ros.Astrobee) Fault with id # occurred. Fault error message: Didn't receive a heartbeat from &lt;node&gt;
</pre><p>Please see the 'Multiple Heartbeat Failures' section in <a class="el" href="sim-issues.html">Common Simulation Issues</a> on how to fix this issue.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md541"></a>
ns</h4>
<p>This flag is the namespace of the simulated Astrobee. If you want to know more about ROS namespaces, please see the ROS documentation. This flag is only needed when running multiple robots in simulation. Please see the <a href="#launching-multiple-robots">Launching Multiple Robots</a> section for more information. The default namespace is blank.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md542"></a>
robot</h4>
<p>This flag tells the flight software which configuration file to read. If you don't have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, you need to use the sim_pub configuration so that the system doesn't complain about the missing bridge. Otherwise, we recommend not setting this flag because the configuration for each Astrobee is specific to the robot's hardware and it is unknown if the hardware configuration will break something in simulation. If you need to run multiple robots in simulation, please leave the robot flag set to sim_pub or the default, sim, and instead set the namespace flag when spawning a robot.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md543"></a>
default_robot</h4>
<p>This flag tells ROS to launch the default robot into the world. If you are having performance issues starting up the simulator, you may want to launch the world without the default robot and then spawn the robot after the simulator starts up. For more information on this, please see the 'Issues Starting up the Simulator' section in <a class="el" href="sim-issues.html">Common Simulation Issues</a>. To launch the world without the default robot, please run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch default_robot:=false
</pre><h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md544"></a>
perch</h4>
<p>This flag tells the simulation to start Astrobee in a perch ready position. After the simulation has started up, you should be able to issue a perch command and Astrobee will perch on a handrail on the deck.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md545"></a>
world</h4>
<p>This flag tells ROS which world to launch. There are 2 Astrobee worlds; the ISS and the granite lab (a model of the actual testbed at Ames). By default, this is set to the ISS world. If you want to test in the granite lab, launch the simulation using the following: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch dds:=false robot:=sim_pub rviz:=true world:="granite"
</pre><p><em>Note: If you have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, please omit the dds and robot flags.</em></p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md546"></a>
debug</h4>
<p>The Astrobee flight software is still in development and there are bugs that we don't always catch. If you come across a bug that crashes the flight software, please help us fix it. To help us, we need to know what happened. The crashed output should state the node that caused the crash. If it isn't clear which node it was, please email us the output and we can help. Once you have the name of the node, please set the debug flag to the node name. This flag will cause a GNU Debugger(GDB) terminal to pop up. Once the code crashes, navigate to the GDB terminal, type <code>bt</code>, and hit enter. This should display a backtrace. Please copy the backtrace and send it to us. Here is an example of launching the simulator and debugging the executive node: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch dds:=false robot:=sim_pub rviz:=true debug:="executive" 
</pre><p><em>Note: If you have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, please omit the dds and robot flags.</em></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md547"></a>
Moving the Robot</h2>
<p>There are currently 3 ways to move the robot in simulation: using the Ground Data System gui, using the command line teleop tool, or programmatically by creating a guest science application that uses the astrobee api library.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md548"></a>
Ground Data System</h3>
<p>The Ground Data System or GDS is our control station. It sends commands to Astrobee and displays telemetry from Astrobee. Using GDS is the preferred way to for an operator to operate Astrobee. Please follow one of the two sections based on the type of user you are.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md549"></a>
External Users</h4>
<p>You can find the GDS software on github in the <a href="github.com/nasa/astrobe_gds">astrobee_gds repo</a>. If you want to compile and run GDS, you will need to aquire the RTI libraries. If you just want to run GDS, we are able to distribute the GDS executable. You will also need to have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed for GDS to communicate with Astrobee. As with GDS, you need the RTI libraries in order to compile the Astrobee communication nodes but we are able to distribute the communications debians that allow you to install and run the Astrobee communication nodes without compiling the code. Please contact your Astrobee point of contact if you would like the GDS executable and/or the Astrobee communications debians.</p>
<p>Our script to launch GDS expects GDS to be in a certain location on your machine. Thus, if you would like to use simulator GDS flag, please make a folder in your home directory called GDS and in that directory, make a symbolic link called 'latest' to the unextracted gds folder you received from your Astrobee point of contact. If you want, you can put the unextracted folder in the gds folder you created. Here's a rough idea of what to do: </p><pre class="fragment">mkdir ~/gds
pushd ~/gds
unzip ~/Downloads/AstroBeeWB.rbuild#.date-time-linux.gtk.x86_64.zip
ln -s AstroBeeWB.rbuild#.date-time latest
popd
</pre><h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md550"></a>
Internal Users</h4>
<p>If you are interested in running GDS, please follow the <a href="https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/confluence/display/FFFSW/Running+GDS+in+Linux">Running GDS in Linux</a> page on the FreeFlyer FSW Confluence space.</p>
<p>If you plan on working on GDS code, please checkout the bitbucket <a href="ssh://git@babelfish.arc.nasa.gov:7999/astrobee/astrobee_gds.git">astrobee_gds repo</a> and follow the SETUP documentation. If you followed the NASA Astrobee install instructions, you will have the RTI libraries already installed. Please make sure you set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the correct RTI location when following the 'Run the Control Station for the first time' section.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md551"></a>
Teleop Tool</h3>
<p>A teleop tool has been added to allow you to issue some of the basic Astrobee commands and get a small set of telemetry from the robot. This should only be used to play with the simulator and get a feel for how Astrobee works. As an external user, we consider you to be a guest scientist and we expect you to follow the guest science framework we have created. Please see the <a href="#guest-science-applications">Guest Science Applications</a> section for more information.</p>
<p>For information on how to use the teleop tool, please see the <a class="el" href="teleop.html">Teleoperation Tool Instructions</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md552"></a>
Guest Science Applications</h3>
<p>If you are a guest scientist, please make sure you have the astrobee_android NASA GitHub project checked out (if you followed the usage instructions, you should have checked this out already). For more information on guest science and how to create guest science applications, please see <a href="https://github.com/nasa/astrobee_android/blob/master/README.md"><code>astrobee_android/readme.md</code></a> located in the <code>astrobee_android/</code> folder.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md553"></a>
Images</h2>
<p>When running RVIZ, you may notice the big "No Image" text in the two <code>DEBUG</code> windows that are meant to show camera information. This is because, by default, we don't publish simulated camera images for the navigation and dock cameras due to the fact that simulating these images is very resource intensive. If you do want to generate these images, please open <code>astrobee/config/simulation/simulation.config</code> and change one or more of <code>nav_cam_rate</code> and <code>dock_cam_rate</code> to something other than 0. We recommend setting these values to 1 meaning these images will be published once per second. After this, you should see those images when you start the simulator. Please note this only works when the namespace is blank. In other words, please don't use the ns flag when launching the simulator if you want to see the images. To show sci camera images, modify analogously the <code>sci_cam_rate</code> field, and enable this camera from the <code>Panels</code> menu in RVIZ.</p>
<p><b>Important</b> Unless you have a high performance machine, there is a good chance that these images will not initialize properly and you will be looking at the inside of the robot. If this happens, you will need to launch the world and Astrobee separately. Please follow the issues starting up the simulator section in <a class="el" href="sim-issues.html">Common Simulation Issues</a> with one caveat. DO NOT start up Astrobee (i.e. don't issue the second terminal command) until 30 to 40 seconds after RVIZ has started up. If you have a low performance computer, this fix may not be the only thing you have to do to fix the images. Please try reducing the speed of your simulator as well. For information on how to reduce the simulator speed, please see the <a href="#speed">speed</a> flag section.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md554"></a>
Launching Multiple Robots</h2>
<p>The Astrobee simulator supports running up to three robots. Please keep in mind that each simulated robot takes computer resources and can cause simulator issues if your machine cannot support the extra load.</p>
<p>The robot namespaces we support are "bumble", "queen", and "honey". Please DO NOT capitalize the namespace. When starting the simulator, you can either start with no robots or you can start with the default robot and one of the namespaces. To start the simulator without a robot, please run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch default_robot:=false
</pre><p>To start with the default robot using a namespace, please run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee sim.launch ns:=honey dds:=false robot:=sim_pub
</pre><p>To spawn robots into the simulator, run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee spawn.launch ns:=bumble dds:=false robot:=sim_pub pose:="11 -7 4.5 0 0 0 1"
roslaunch astrobee spawn.launch ns:=queen dds:=false robot:=sim_pub pose:="11 -4 4.5 0 0 0 1"
</pre><p><em>Note: If you have the Astrobee communication nodes compiled or installed, please omit the dds and robot flags.</em></p>
<p><b>Important</b> If you issue the roslaunch commands too close together, the robot may not start up properly. Please allow 15 to 20 seconds in between each roslaunch command.</p>
<p>Each robot's ROS topics, services and actions are now prefixed with the supplied namespace, which allows you to interact with them individually. So, if you are using the teleop tool to command the robots, be sure to specify the namespace of the robot you want to command. For example: </p><pre class="fragment">rosrun executive teleop_tool -ns "honey" -undock 
</pre><p><em>Note: The simulator and teleop tool may be able to support more than 3 robots if needed. However, GDS only supports 3 robots so the documentation limits spawning to 3. We will leave it as an exercise for the user to launch more than 3 robots.</em></p>
